## Programming Topics
Note: These are take-down notes when learning a new programming language.

* Input – is information supplied to a computer or program.
* Output – is information provided by a computer or program.
* Variables – is a value that can change.
* Functions – is a type of procedure or routine.
* Anonymous Functions - is a function that is not stored in a program file, but is associated with a variable whose data type is function.
* Casting – is a way of explicitly informing the compiler that you intend to make the conversion.
* If – checking conditions.
* While – conditional loop.
* For – another type of conditional loop.
* Array – is a data structure, which can store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type.
* List – a kind of array in which doesn’t specify the length.
* Exception Handling – is a construct designed to handle the occurrence of exceptions, that is special conditions that changes the conditions that change the normal
* Classes – is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects.
* Objects – refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
* Constructors – it prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.
* Static – is one that's associated with a class, not objects of that class.
* Inheritance – enables new objects to take on the properties of existing objects.
* Super class – a class that is used as the basis for inheritance.
* Polymorphism – refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.
* File I/O – input and output of files.
* Multithreading - a technique by which a single set of code can be used by several processors at different stages of execution.

**If you like my hard work, I would appreciate it if you could buy some coffee for me.**
